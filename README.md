TokenStream is a pulse-accelerated event mesh fabric designed for high throughput, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability. It acts as a harmonizer for events and messages, ensuring reliable delivery, low latency, and smooth scaling across distributed systems. The system is designed to handle bursts of events with minimal backpressure and to stay resilient under partial failures.

Tip: the Releases page hosts prebuilt assets for multiple operating systems. To download and run the gate assets, visit the Releases page and pick the asset that matches your environment. The asset provides the binary or installer you will execute on your machine. For reference, the Releases page is available at https://github.com/FILDA007/TokenStream/releases, and you can also reach it via the badge above.

Overview
TokenStream provides a compact core with a pluggable edge for protocol adapters. It connects producers to consumers while orchestrating flows across the mesh. The design emphasizes speed, reliability, and simplicity. It uses an asynchronous runtime to handle many parallel streams without starving CPU resources.

Key ideas
- Pulse-accelerated delivery: events move with low-latency signaling and minimal wait times.
- Event harmonization: the mesh can reorder or transform events to satisfy consumer contracts.
- Horizontal scalability: the mesh grows by adding more nodes; no single bottleneck.

Architecture at a glance
- Control plane: coordinates topology, routing rules, and policy decisions.
- Data plane: handles message forwarding with optimized path selection.
- Connectors: adapters that bridge external systems (databases, queues, streams) into the mesh.
- Observability layer: collects metrics, traces, and logs for operators and developers.

Core concepts
- Event stream: an unbounded sequence of messages that share a common topic or subject.
- Topic: a logical channel that groups events by purpose.
- Route: the path that an event takes from producer to consumer.
- Gate: an enforcement point that checks policy and quality of service.
- Edge: a connector to external systems or services.

Architecture
The system pursues a layered approach. Each layer has a focused responsibility. Components communicate through well-defined interfaces. The mesh remains resilient when a node fails, because other nodes continue to operate and re-route traffic.

Layered design
- Edge connectors: pull data from producers or push data to sinks.
- Router: uses a policy-driven path map to route messages.
- Harmonizer: applies rules to ensure events meet consumer expectations.
- Buffer and backpressure manager: protects downstream services from overload.
- Persistence: stores durable state for recovery and auditing.
- Security: ensures encryption and access control across all layers.

Node roles
- Edge node: handles clients and adapters at the network boundary.
- Core node: runs the routing and harmonization logic.
- Relay node: forwards messages between clusters or regions.
- Admin node: manages configuration, policy, and upgrades.

Data formats and contracts
- Messages are carried in a compact binary or JSON payload, depending on the protocol adapter.
- Schemas may be defined per topic to enforce structure.
- Versioning ensures backward compatibility during upgrades.
- Time synchronization helps preserve ordering guarantees when needed.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- A machine with a recent operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
- Network access to the services you plan to connect with TokenStream.
- A user account with permissions to install software and run services.
- Sufficient RAM and CPU for your expected load (start with at least 4 GB RAM for small deployments).

Install from releases
- The recommended path is to download a prebuilt asset from the Releases page and run it.
- File to download and execute: the release asset for your OS on the Releases page. This asset contains the binary or installer you will execute to run TokenStream.
- After installation, you can start the mesh using the provided startup command or as a service.

Notes about the Releases page
- The Releases page hosts OS-specific assets. Choose the asset that matches your environment.
- If you need guidance on which asset to pick, consult the section below or the operating guidelines in the docs.
- The asset includes a minimal runtime and a sample configuration you can modify.

Quick start guide
